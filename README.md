# Horiseon -- Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description 
This project refactors the code for the Horiseon website to facilitate accessibility through the addition of alt text for each image. It also includes some additional code to make sure a proper title shows up. I streamlined the semantic html, for instance by removing excessive uses of the id= tag. And I refactored the list elements in the CSS to make sure they fall into sequential order. I learned that I could not use the same coding format to include alt text for the background image as I could for the other images on the page. The project also now contains a precise descriptive title element. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To see the alt text additions without a screen reader, use Chrome dev tools by pressing command+option+I (MacOS) or control+shift+I (windows). You can also doubleclick on the front page, and then press the inspect command, to open dev tools.

## Credits 
Because the background image is linked in the CSS here, the standard alt text designations in the html didn't work so I sourced code from [here](http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html#:~:text=Summary&text=For%20ambient%20images%20that%20are,be%20used%20for%20information%20content.) It gave me the information necessary to create alt text in the html file for the background image. 

I also used [this tutorial](https://docs.readme.com/main/docs/linking-to-pages#:~:text=To%20link%20inline%2C%20type%20the,%2C%20%22(y)%22.&text=Reference%2Dstyle%20linking%20allows%20you,refer%20to%20it%20multiple%20times.)to help me learn how to add links to a readme file.
